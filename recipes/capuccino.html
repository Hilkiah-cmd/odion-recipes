        <h4>Why Capuccino?.</h4>
        <p>cappuccino is a coffee drink that today is typically composed of a single espresso shot and hot milk, with the surface topped with foamed milk. Cappuccinos are most often prepared with an espresso machine. The espresso is poured into the bottom of the cup, followed by a similar amount of hot milk, which is prepared by heating and texturing the milk using the espresso machine steam wand. The top third of the drink consists of milk foam; this foam can be decorated with artistic drawings made with the same milk, called latte art.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons finely ground dark roast coffee</li>
            <li>4 ounces water</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Place the water into the boiler of your espresso machine.</li>
            <li>Place the 2 tablespoons (2 shots) of ground coffee into the portafil</li>
            <li>Tamp (press) the coffee down using a tamper. Do this 2 to 3 times to make sure the grounds are packed tightly.</li>
            <li>Place the portafilter into your espresso machine's group head and lock it in place by turning it to the right.</li>
            <li>Place a demitasse cup or the glass carafe that came with your espresso machine under the group head and pull the shot for 23 to 30 seconds, or until 2 ounces of espresso is yielded. Typically, there is a lever, switch, or button to start this process.</li>
            <li>Once the shot is pulled, foam the milk.</li>
